\title{Trainer: Interpret FactoMineR::LinearModel with an LLM-ready prompt}
\usage{
trainer_LinearModel(
  lm_obj,
  introduction = NULL,
  alpha = 0.05,
  t_test = NULL,
  audience = c("beginner", "applied", "advanced"),
  summary_only = FALSE,
  llm_model = "llama3",
  generate = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{lm_obj}{An object returned by FactoMineR::LinearModel(...).}

\item{introduction}{Optional character string giving the study context.
Defaults to a generic description.}

\item{alpha}{Numeric significance level used as instruction for the LLM
(no computation is performed). Default 0.05.}

\item{t_test}{Optional character vector to filter the T-test section by
factor names and/or interactions expressed as "A:B". If NULL, all rows
are shown.}

\item{audience}{One of c("beginner","applied","advanced").}

\item{summary_only}{Logical; if TRUE, return a 3-bullet executive summary
regardless of audience depth.}

\item{llm_model}{Character model name for the generator (e.g., "llama3").}

\item{generate}{Logical; if TRUE, call trainer_core_generate_or_return()
and return a list with prompt, response, and model. If FALSE, return
the prompt string.}
}
\value{
Character prompt (if generate = FALSE) or a list with
  prompt, response, and model.
}
\description{
Builds an English-only, audience-tailored prompt to interpret a
FactoMineR::LinearModel result. Handles selection = "aic", "bic",
or "none". Never invents numbers: passes verbatim output and instructs
interpretation only.

# --- Example 1: multiple regression with selection (ham) -------------------
data(ham)
if (requireNamespace("FactoMineR", quietly = TRUE)) {
  intro_ham <- "A sensory analysis institute wants to know if it's possible to predict
  the overall liking of a ham from its sensory description.
  A trained panel used the following attributes to describe 21 hams:
  Juiciness, Crispy, Tenderness, Pasty, Fibrous, Salty, Sweet, Meaty,
  Seasoned, Metallic, Ammoniated, Fatty, Braised, Lactic.
  Afterward, an Overall Liking score was assigned to each of the hams."

# --- Example 2: interaction with a categorical factor (deforestation) ------
data(deforestation)

  the relationship between water and air temperature.
  The dataset contains maximum air and water temperatures measured over
  28 ten-day periods before deforestation and 28 periods after deforestation.
  The main objective is to understand if and how the link between air and
  water temperature changes after deforestation."
